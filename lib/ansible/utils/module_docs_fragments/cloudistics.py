notes:
  - Authentication parameters such as API_KEY and ENDPOINT_URL are not allowed in
    playbooks for security reasons. Please use `ccli setup` to create a configuration
    file.
  - Auth information is driven by the cloudistics python library, which means that 
    values can come from an ini config file in /etc/cloudistics.conf or ~/.cloudistics,
    then finally from standard environment variables. More information can be found at
    U(https://cloudistics-api-python-client.readthedocs.io)
